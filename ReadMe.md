# Numerical Differentiation using Finite Difference

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`


## Step
Execute the code in file Assign3.py using Python 3.x to create the result for Question 1-4


## Example:
plot_grad_approx(10)    # plot the exponential gradient and centered difference approximation
plot_order_diff()   # plot the error of finite difference approximation
order_diff_high()   # plot the error of finite difference using high order of accuracy
